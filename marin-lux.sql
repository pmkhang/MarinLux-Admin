('NiXc-dzDB-dfVy-gCzt', 'Solandge', 'SOLANDGE’s exterior design is the work of the celebrated Espen Oeino who has successfully created harmonious lines and balanced proportions that encase a vast selection of versatile outdoor living, dining, and entertainment areas. Her panoramic upper deck plays host to a chic beach club area with a customised dance floor, Jacuzzi, and wet bar, whilst the bridge deck is ideal for relaxation and casual al fresco dining with a spacious seating area. Setting out to create a number of spaces in which family and friends would be able to spend time together, Espen Oeino has also included a number of bars, buffet areas, and even a large swimming pool, so whether guests want to party or unwind together, there is a dedicated section on board superyacht SOLANDGE to do so.The stunning interior of SOLANDGE is the result of a collaboration between Rodriguez Interiors and Dolker&amp;Voges, between them using more than 49 different marble and granite surfaces and 33 alternative woods. Stylish yet classically elegant with a hint of opulence, SOLANDGE’s interior spaces boast a number of unique areas to accommodate all needs, ranging from a large indoor movie theatre, to a vast main salon with bar, games room, and seating areas. Sourcing rare materials in Venice, Rodriguez has provided SOLANDGE with a number of unique Murano glassworks which, combined with Schonbeck chandeliers and finely grained woods, create a distinctly glamorous aesthetic throughout the yacht. Whilst there’s numerous  feats of design to be found in both the social and private spaces, it is perhaps the 50-foot lighted sculpture in the atrium lobby which is the crowning achievement. Dubbed the ‘tree of life’, the column extends from the tank deck up to the upper deck and is composed of precisely 1,423 points of light.Motor yacht SOLANDGE sleeps up to 12 guests in seven exceptional staterooms, including a panoramic master deck featuring 180 degree windows, private dressing room, his and hers bathrooms and a private deck with spa pool. Additional guest rooms include a full-beam VIP suite which can be converted into two spacious cabins and a further two doubles and two twin cabins.&nbsp;Whilst each of the cabins bears its own unique colour scheme, the decoration &nbsp;of each room reflects the opulence found elsewhere on board. With their famous eye for materials and textures, Rodriguez Interiors have carefully selected handmade Italian furniture and overseen highly intricate stonework to ensure that everyone on board is able to sleep in absolute luxury.Featuring a dance floor complete with a DJ booth, the sundeck of SOLANDGE is no doubt the place to be when underway, whilst the traditional beach club offers the ideal space to enjoy the water when at-anchor. Annexed with a large tenders and toys garage, the beach club includes a sizable rainforest-style shower which makes freshening up after being out on the water an absolute joy. In the tender garage, guests are able to use impressive touch screen pads to determine the temperature of the water and speed of the wind- an invaluable tool when it comes to deciding between diving in for a swim or boarding a kayak to set about exploring. On the bridge deck there is also a fully-equipped health spa featuring a spacious massage room, sauna, and a gymnasium leading out onto a glass-edged plunge pool. Fully-trained experienced members of crew are on hand here to pamper guests with a number of on-board treatments surrounded with beautiful design features such as the custom glass wall in the sauna.Superyacht SOLANDGE is very much a yacht defined by her array of special features. Indeed, from her expansive and elegantly styled owner&rsquo;s deck, to her perspex dance floor to her hugely stocked toy garage, &nbsp;it&rsquo;s clear that she prides herself on being nothing short of exceptional. Espen Oeino&rsquo;s decision to have lower bulwarks has also meant that views across the ocean are completely uninterrupted, so much so that it&rsquo;s possible to look out from the bed of the owner&rsquo;s suite and take in the scenery on offer.In addition to state-of-the-art audio visual and communication systems on board, SOLANDGE also features an ultra-modern zero speed stabilization system which reduces roll motion effect and results in a smoother, more enjoyable cruising and berthing experience. With a cruising speed of 14 knots, a maximum speed of 18 knots and a range of 6000nm from her 220000litre fuel tanks, her performance is unquestionably of the same standard as her outstanding leisure facilities.When not cruising Solandge has onboard an incredible selection of water toys and accessories for you and your guests to connect with the waters around you.

('QiN9-hj0E-KFdZ-vBFX', 'Nautilus', 'Designed by the French naval architect Philippe Briand, the elegant hull of superyacht NAUTILUS was shaped with both hydrodynamics and space in mind. Indeed, whilst her plumb bow ensures efficient performance, it also maximises the waterline length and provides plenty of volume for the French designer Remi Tessier to carry out his iconic minimalist styling to full effect. On the sundeck, Tessier has extended his usual preference for uninterrupted spaces to produce an environment which nicely captures the Zen the owner’s specifically requested. Anticipating both sunbathers and leisurely guests, a number of custom sunpads which are able to rotate 360° have been partnered with similarly bespoke sun loungers with built-in biminis for instant shade. Keen to provide every reason to enjoy meals alfresco, a table has been slightly lowered to provide a private and intimate dining experience with unobstructed views extending well over the ocean. Naturally, there’s a sizable Jacuzzi on the main deck aft in order to take in the tropical climate in style, and a coffee bar at the aft deck which can be easily converted to a cocktail bar when the evening calls for more drinks. Perhaps the crowning feature of the exterior is the LEDs which have been installed above the social areas, which, when lit, discreetly communicate to the crew that guests are politely asking for a degree of privacy. Getting between these various areas could not be easier, as Superyacht NAUTILUS features a walk around layout which nicely lends itself for brisk evening strolls at sunset. With her tender garage opening up on the port side, guests are able to enjoy the sizable swim platform off the stern of NAUTILUS without having to compete for room with inflatable toys and snorkelling equipment. Of course, the more adventurous party members will be only too satisfied with the range of toys on offer, and there’s assuredly endless hours of fun on the water to be had.   In the interior of superyacht NAUTILUS lighting plays a huge role. Indeed, overhead lighting, recessed lighting, and even illuminated furniture combine to create a quietly sophisticated ambience which is at the same time wholly inviting. Space also plays a big role in the interior- there’s over two metres of headroom in the main salon, for instance, and the layout is largely open-plan to make moving through the yacht a memorable experience in itself. In terms of texture, Tessier has selected an assortment of light sycamore, bleached wenge, and even some high gloss ebony for certain window frames. With careful attention to contouring and accents of palladium, both the social and private spaces found indoors are as comfortable as they are aesthetically impressive. The main salon, for example, bears a light grey colour scheme and multiple seating options surrounding a collection of coffee tables. Instead of an abundance of decorative fixtures, Tessier has simply added a unique artwork by the American artist Edward Ruscha, a finishing touch which completes the area in a suitably outstanding fashion. Other areas inside are entirely consistent with such a principle-  the additional salon and dining area both provide lounging options in a strikingly contemporary setting. Unsurprisingly, such an impressive interior ultimately led NAUTILUS to receive a number of awards at the Monaco Yacht Show Awards the year she was delivered, and continues to impress every kind of charter guest she welcomes on-board.Spread across two decks, the seven cabins available to guests each possess large windows to allow for an abundance of natural light to complement the electric lighting on offer. Similar to the social spaces, all of the cabins are outfitted with bright and comfortable furnishings, meaning that guests can enjoy time alone whilst not having to sacrifice an inch on the beauty of their surroundings. The master suite on the main deck includes his and hers bathrooms nicely separated by a limestone bath, as well as additional seating on either side of the bed.Possessing plenty of garage space, NAUTILUS comes with a veritable arsenal of towable water toys and snorkelling equipment to keep everyone occupied whilst it&rsquo;s warm outside. For those more inclined towards chilling out with a couple of drinks, an observation room on the upper deck allows guests to greet the coasts on the horizon and take some stunning photographs from an unrivalled vantage point. Another feature of NAUTILUS sure to arrest the attention of charter guests is the Oculus entertainment system. Connected to the various television screens on board, guests are able to use the system to track their position in real time as well as switching over to watch footage of the yacht as it carries them along.When designing NAUTILUS, her owners paid particular attention to methods which would adequately reduce the noise on board. Via multiple strategies including sound dampening and other innovative approaches, decibel readings in the master suite when cruising at 14 knots showed there was only 42.6dB- which could be heard- a level just above a whisper. What&rsquo;s more, eco-friendly systems have been installed to ensure less damage to the waters the superyacht moves through. Such engineering features include an exhaust route which mitigates fumes as well as a waste management process which operates at optimum efficiency. As an expedition yacht, NAUTILUS&nbsp;also comes with dynamic positioning, a system which allows her to remain stationary without the use of an anchor as well as having greater manoeuvrability around ports.The upper deck is completely dedicated to wellness, with a spa, massage suite, hydrotherapy bath, and even a hair salon on offer for guests in need of some refreshment. As well as being annexed by small and casual dining tables, the space is flanked by large windows to create a suitably harmonious tone. Enclosed by expansive sliding windows, the gymnasium on offer brings together all of the equipment and facilities necessary for a truly satisfying workout whilst looking out across the ocean.As a custom displacement yacht, NAUTILUS&nbsp;also features &lsquo;at anchor stabilisers&rsquo; which work at zero speed, increasing onboard comfort whilst at anchor or on rough waters. NAUTILUS&nbsp;is built to comply to MCA and Lloyds Register standards. With a cruising speed of 14 knots, a maximum speed of 16.5 knots and a range of 7,000nm from her 185,000litre fuel tanks, she is the perfect combination of performance and luxury.Nautilus knows a thing or two about fun on the water, with an extensive selection of action packed water toys and accessories for you and your guests to enjoy whilst on charter.  Take to the sea on the Jet Skis offering you power and control on the water.  Guests can feel the wind in their hair and jump the waves on one of the four Seadoo WaveRunners. Discover the world beneath the surface of the ocean with the dive gear and compressor.  If that isn\'t enough Nautilus also features a seabob, kayaks, inflatable water toys, paddleboards and snorkelling equipment. When it comes to Tenders, Nautilus has you covered - with four tenders, including a 9.2m/30\'2\" Cockwells Jet Tender. There are few superyachts which unify their interior and exterior spaces with a seamlessness equal to superyacht NAUTILUS.&nbsp;Capable of sleeping up to 12 guests across a range of 7 staterooms, and with an attendant crew of 20, it&rsquo;s not difficult to see why she&rsquo;s a superb choice for both families and small parties looking to enjoy an elite luxury experience.

('QJPC-c9l4-8lXj-qOEM', 'Whisper', 'Featuring the pioneering styling of the acclaimed Espen Oeino, the exterior of superyacht WHISPER has been gracefully shaped in order to meet the owner’s brief for a yacht which would be an unrivalled charter choice and a premier entertainer.    Built with a steel hull and aluminum superstructure, she is sleek, and replete with all of the amenities necessary for satisfying the modern charterer. One such conversation point regarding her exterior is the mosaic tiled pool with an inset Jacuzzi on the upper foredeck. Due to its position, this Jacuzzi affords guests the perfect observation platform from which to overlook the sea and coastlines whilst underway or at-anchor. For those who prefer to remain dry whilst taking in the sights, four Stidd chairs have been strategically placed around the Jacuzzi in order to provide the same scope without obstructing the view of those taking a soak. To get even higher to secure an unparalleled photo opportunity, a winding staircase a short distance away provides access to a dedicated observation deck which can be enjoyed throughout the day. Bearing a walkaround layout, the team at Espen Oeino have recessed all of the storage compartments  to allow for an undisrupted flow when navigating the various outdoor spaces of WHISPER- a decision which likewise provides the perfect excuse for taking an evening stroll to coincide with the sunset. Another uniquely impressive addition to the exterior is the secondary helipad on the foredeck which nicely doubles up as a basketball court, whilst the helipad on the bridge deck is easily converted into an exceptionally relaxed outdoor lounging area. Keen to keep guests entertained at night as well as by day, a fire pit with an integrated waterfall has been installed on the aft deck to provide just the right amount of heat for guests who want to enjoy their meals al freso at the dining table just a short distance away. Of course, it goes without saying that the four foot black jaguar resting on the bowsprit of superyacht WHISPER is very much the finishing touch to such a superbly arranged exterior. Asked to create a compelling and distinct interior based on a ‘Champagne &amp; Caviar’ theme, Reymond Langton Design have arranged both the social and private spaces to remain suitable whether guests are throwing a glamorous party or simply relaxing over a few drinks. Similar to the innovation found outdoors, the interior of superyacht WHISPER features a double-height main salon which spans the main and upper deck aft. Reached via a sweeping staircase, this area is infused with a colour scheme and architecture reminiscent of the Art Deco movement. Indeed, the juxtaposition of blacks and golds creates a strikingly luxurious ambience which is perfect for indulging both after-hours champagne and morning coffee. Nicely flexible, guests can have jazz tunes coming from the grand piano if they’re entertaining, or light one of the two fireplaces if it’s a more cozy vibe they’re after. The skylounge, meanwhile, exudes a more casual atmosphere thanks to its beach house style decor. Yet, with a large sports bar that opens out across the vast deck aft, the space easily transforms into a disco nightclub. A veritable masterpiece, the owner&rsquo;s suite of superyacht WHISPER occupies the forward half of the upper deck. Featuring his and hers bathing rooms, room-size wardrobes, and even a private Jacuzzi, this suite comes with a personal office for attending to any necessary business whilst away on vacation. The two generously sized VIP suites on the main deck reflect the Art Nouveau influences which can be traced in the interior social spaces, whilst the remaining staterooms adopt Art Deco and Japanese themes to provide a stunning array of sleeping options. Ultimately, whichever room guests find themselves resting in on-board WHISPER, they can be assured that they&rsquo;ll be doing so in total style.As well as providing a cinema screen on the foredeck, a party-friendly and spacious main salon, and a wealth of lounging spots on her exterior, WHISPER also offers a range of &nbsp;possibilities for enjoying some activities. Storing her impressive range of tenders and toys in a garage which doubles up as a spot for some waterside aerobics and yoga, superyacht WHISPER is also fully prepared for the more adventurous charter guests who are keen to get out on the water and in amongst the action.Designed in conjunction with a sports loving owner, WHISPER features a dedicated club room which can also be converted into a comfortably sized cinema. What&rsquo;s more, the staircase leading into the main salon is flanked by two full-height video walls which mean guests can enjoy some drinks and company whilst keeping up the game. With an eye for greener alternatives to standard engineering, superyacht WHISPER features an innovative &lsquo;closed loop system&rsquo; which allows the pool, Jacuzzi, and other sources of water to be heated via her exhaust- yet further evidence that she is a yacht at the forefront of design.Located on the lower deck, a fully dedicated spa area features both a beauty salon and gymnasium to take care of guests whilst they&rsquo;re away on vacation. Consistent with the intricate design work found elsewhere on-board, this space boasts hand-crafted and commissioned artwork, tailored furnishings, and incredibly soothing textures to create an effortlessly relaxed ambience.As a custom displacement yacht, WHISPER also features &lsquo;at anchor stabilisers&rsquo; which work at zero speed, increasing onboard comfort at anchor and on rough waters.
